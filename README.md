# fast-fan-in

Golang fan-in pattern efficiently adaptable to any channel type without code generation

## Rationale

Channels provide an elegant mechanism for distributing work among many goroutines, and
there are [many excellent concurrent design patterns](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines) for doing scalable processing
of data using channels.

In particular, fanning data out to a group of worker goroutines and collecting the results
of their work is a useful pattern, but implementing fan-in is nontrivial. A complete
implementation for integers looks like this:

```go
func FanIn(done <-chan struct{}, inputs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
	results := make(chan int)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	fan := func(input <-chan int) {
		defer wg.Done()
		for {
			select {
			case <-done:
				return
			case element, more := <-input:
				if !more {
					return
				}
				results <- element
			}
		}
	}
	for _, input := range inputs {
		wg.Add(1)
		go fan(input)
	}
	go func() {
		defer close(results)
		wg.Wait()
	}()
	return results
}
```

This code must be re-implemented for every type of data that you want to send
over the channels, and therefore is extremely non-DRY in pratice.

We wrote this package to implement fan-in once, but in a way that can be re-used
any type of channel element. We also wanted a solution that is approximately as
fast as re-implementing the code for each type.

We've built a system that uses a minimal quantity of reflection (none on the
hot path) combined with anonymous functions that capture type information to achieve
good performance on channels of any element type.

## Benchmarks

The graph below visualizes the relative performance of fanning-in channels three
ways:

- **Concrete**: Code specialized completely to the channel type (like the snippet above)
- **Hybrid**: Our approach with an anonymous function that provides the type information
- **Reflect**: Our fallback 100% reflection-based approach (which is the fastest reflection-
  based option that we could figure out).

![benchmark visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/fast-fan-in/master/img/benchmarks.png)

Each cluster of bars represents a different number of elements sent through the
fan.

The nine bars in each cluster are the three different approaches using three different
quantities of channels. Here is a key for the bars (there's also one in the bottom right,
but it's hard to read):

1. **Concrete** with 1 channel
2. **Concrete** with 10 channels
3. **Concrete** with 100 channels
4. **Hybrid** with 1 channel
5. **Hybrid** with 10 channels
6. **Hybrid** with 100 channels
7. **Reflect** with 1 channel
8. **Reflect** with 10 channels
9. **Reflect** with 100 channels

The rightmost set of bars reflects the results from the benchmark which sent 100,000
elements through the channels. You can see that the y-axis indicates that the
**Concrete** and **Hybrid** approaches perform nearly the same for all quantities of
channels tested, while the **Reflect** approach suffers a steep penalty.

## Usage

Fan several channels of a custom type into one channel:

```go
type MyCustomType struct {
    // many fields
}

// we got these three channel variables from some previous logic that
// launched goroutines that are writing values on them
var a, b, c chan MyCustomType

// let's assume that data is flowing over these three channels

// we combine these three channels and provide a function that tells the fan about the
// specific element type that will flow over the channels by performing type assertions
out := fan.Config{
    SelectFunc: func(done <-chan struct{}, in, out interface{}) bool {
        select {
        case <-done:
            return true
        case element, more := <-in.(chan MyCustomType):
            if !more {
                return true
            }
            out.(chan MyCustomType) <- element
        }
        return false
    },
}.FanIn(done, a, b, c).(<-chan MyCustomType)
// note that we also type-assert the returned channel to be the appropriate
// element type!

// now we can read all of the data from those three channels on out!
for data := range out {
    fmt.Println(data)
}
```
